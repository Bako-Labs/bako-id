# What is Bako ID?

`Bako ID` is a Name System for the FUEL network. Our primary goal is to establish a secure, stable, and efficient
tool that provides all users and projects within this network with access to a high-quality NS protocol

## What is Identity?

Identity or `@` allow you to create your own identifier in web3, mapping your human-readable handler `@bako_id`
to an address such as a `B256Address`.
The Identity is owned by its owner, however, when using it, it is possible to add another address for its resolution.

| Property | Description                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Owner    | Address of the identity owner       |
| Resolver | Address for the identity resolution |

<!-- ## Handler prices

The identity price is calculated by the number of characters, for example, registering the identity `@now` will cost `0.005 ETH`.

::: info About identity size and chars
Your `@` identity is not considered in the price calculation, only the subsequent characters.

| Domain size     |   Price    |
| --------------- | :--------: |
| 3 chars         | 0.005 ETH  |
| 4 chars         | 0.001 ETH  |
| 5 or more chars | 0.0002 ETH | -->
