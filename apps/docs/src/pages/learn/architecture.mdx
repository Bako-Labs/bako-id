## Smart Contracts

Bako ID has 2 contracts for its core functioning, these contracts are one responsible for registering and searching
the identity `Register` and another for the storage of its identities `Storage`.

## Storage Contract

This contract was conceived in a more abstract way to consider how the identity can be stored and, primarily, to ensure
that it will never be lost even with updates.

The security of this contract is guaranteed through validations, which allow only the owner of this contract and its
implementation to execute the methods.

## Registry contract

The registry, in a nutshell, is like the layer that allows interaction with the handlers, it allows to register a
handler and perform a search by its name.

These methods make the call in storage, both to validate if the handler exists when creating and for the search.

## Methods execution

When executing the Registry contract method, a series of processing is carried out, from byte conversion
to method call validations.

In the demonstration below, we briefly explain how the execution process of the `register` method works.

And here is a brief explanation of the `resolver` method.
