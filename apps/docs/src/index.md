## What is handlers?
Handlers or `@` allow you to create your own identifier in web3, mapping your human-readable handler `@bako_id` 
to an address such as a `B256Address`.
The handler is owned by its owner, however, when using it, it is possible to add another address for its resolution.

| Property | Description                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Owner    | Address of the handler's owner       |
| Resolver | Address for the handler's resolution |


## Handler prices
The handle price is calculated by the number of characters, for example, registering the handler `@now` will cost `0.005 ETH`.

::: info About handler size and chars
 Your `@` handler is not considered in the price calculation, only the subsequent characters.
